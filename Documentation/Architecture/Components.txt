Health

    Properties
    - UInt32 HealthRemaining { get; private set; }
    - UInt32 StartingHealth { get; }

    Methods
    - UInt32 AddHealth(UInt32 amount)
        + Returns HealthRemaining
    - UInt32 SubtractHealth(UInt32 amount)
        + Returns HealthRemaining

Timer

    Properties
    - float RemainingSeconds { get; private set; }
    - float StartingSecodns { get; }

    Methods
    - void Start()
    - void Pause()
    - void Reset()

Behaviors

===============

Behaviors act on Components
Explicit coupling between a behavior and the components it manipulates
    - E.G. a damageable behavior won't do anything if the Game Object has no Health Component.
    - A behavior that moves a Game Object will act on the transform.
    - etc.
